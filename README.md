# Good-practices-in-Data-Science

Currently there are quite many recommendations for the "right way" to do DS.
The practical goal of this project is not only to compile the list of such recom-
mendations but also to explain and provide strong evidence (through simulation
or real data example) why it is important to follow these recommendations. It is
aimed to help building a bridge between statistics and other fields of applications
to people with different level of expertise.
